â˜• Java (Cross-Platform & Strict OOP)

âœ… JVM (Write Once, Run Anywhere) 
    â†’ Code runs on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
âœ… Automatic Garbage Collection     
    â†’ Eliminates manual memory management (unlike C++).
âœ… Checked Exceptions   
    â†’ Forces developers to handle exceptions at compile-time (throws IOException).
âœ… Class-Based OOP (Strict OOP Model) 
    â†’ Everything is inside a class (public class MyClass).
âœ… Multithreading with Built-in Thread Class 
    â†’ Native thread management (new Thread(() -> {...})).
âœ… Java Reflection API 
    â†’ Dynamically inspect and modify code at runtime (Class.forName("MyClass")).
âœ… Security Sandboxing 
    â†’ JVM isolates code execution, preventing security vulnerabilities.
âœ… Rich Standard Library (java.util, java.nio) 
    â†’ Provides built-in support for networking, I/O, and collections.

ðŸ’¡ Best Used For â†’ Enterprise applications, backend services, Android development.
