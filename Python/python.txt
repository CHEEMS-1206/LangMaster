🐍 Python (Simplicity & Rapid Development)

✅ Dynamically Typed 
    → No need to declare variable types (x = "Hello").
✅ Interpreted Language 
    → No compilation required (python script.py).
✅ Duck Typing 
    → Objects are defined by behavior rather than explicit types.
✅ Multi-Paradigm (OOP + Functional + Procedural) 
    → Supports classes, functions, and scripting.
✅ Extensive Standard Library (os, sys, math) 
    → Includes built-in utilities.
✅ Metaprogramming (type(), eval()) 
    → Modify classes and objects at runtime.
✅ Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) 
    → Prevents true multi-threading but simplifies memory management.
✅ Easy-to-Use Async (asyncio) 
    → Supports asynchronous programming, but not as optimized as JavaScript or Rust.
✅ Great for AI/ML & Data Science (NumPy, TensorFlow) 
    → Python dominates in scientific computing.
✅ Dynamic Code Execution (exec(), eval()) 
    → Can run code stored as strings at runtime.

💡 Best Used For → Data science, AI/ML, scripting, web development (Django, Flask).

            _protected   (single underscore)
            __private    (double underscore → name mangling)

        -> Important modifiers / related keywords:
            global          (modify global variable)
            nonlocal        (modify variable in outer scope)

Programming fundamentals in PYTHON 

1.1  Basic Data handling
        Variables and Constants 
            Storage for data values.
            // Variables
                Used to store data values
                Created dynamically (no type declaration)
                Type is decided at runtime
                ex -> price = 99.5

            // Constants 
                Python does not have true constants.
                It has Convention-based constants: 
                ex -> MAX_USERS = 100
                ** Written in UPPERCASE, Can still be changed (by convention, not enforced)

            // Making FINAL for constants - 
                one way to acheive constants properties is by making vars FINAL 
                ex -> from typing import Final
                      PI: Final = 3.14159

        Variable Scoping in Python
            Python follows the LEGB rule: 
                Local → Enclosing → Global → Built-in

                1. LOCAL variable 
                    Variables defined inside a function
                    Accessible only within that function

                2. ENCLOSING variable 
                    Variables in an outer function, accessible to inner functions
                
                3. GLOBAL variable 
                    Variables defined outside all functions.
                    Readable inside functions.
                
                4. BUILT IN variables 
                    Python’s predefined names - ex len, size etc.

        Data Types 
            Python does not distinguish primitive vs non-primitive like Java.
            Everything is an object.

            🔹 Built-in Types (non collection)
                Type	            Description
                int	                Integer numbers
                float	            Decimal numbers
                complex	            Complex numbers
                bool	            Boolean values (True, False)
                str	                Characters & strings (no separate char)

            🔹 Complex / Collection Data Types
                list	            Dynamic array
                tuple	            Immutable list
                set	                Unordered unique collection
                dict	            Key-value map
                bytes	            Immutable byte array
                bytearray	        Mutable byte array

            🔹 User defined types - 
                class
            
        Type System 
            Python is dynamically typed language.
                Variable type is decided at runtime
                No need to define the variable's data type, it is inferred at runtime
                Same variable can reference different types

            Python is also strongly typed language
                Once a variable is declared to be of a certain type, it cannot be used as another type without an explicit conversion (casting).
                Python does NOT allow implicit unsafe conversions

        Type Conversion 
            Implicit Type conversion - 
                Also known as automatic type conversion, it happens when:
                    A type is converted into some other type automatically.
                    Python converts types only when safe.
                    for ex float to int is safe, bt not str to int.
            
            Explicit Type Conversion (Typecasting()) 
                Also called type casting, you do it manually when:
                    A type is converted into a not safe other type.
                    Requires a cast operator: (type)
                    for ex str(100) -> # "100"

                some casting function - 
                    int()
                    float()
                    str()
                    bool()
                    list()
                    tuple()
                    set()
                    dict()

2.  Control Flow
        Conditionals - Used to make decisions based on conditions.
            if, else, switch statements.
            ** Python uses indentation instead of {}, 
            ** Keywords - if, elif, else
                if condition:
                    # if block
                elif condition:
                    # else if block
                else:
                    # else block

            ** Python has match in place of switch 
            ** _ acts like default, so if we place _ after a case that becomes a default case.
                match comparator_value:
                    case val1:
                        # block for this case
                    case val2:
                        # another case
                    case _:
                        # default case (matches anything)

        Loops 
            for, while, do-while (python does not have do while loops).
                ** for loop using iterator -
                ** Used when number of iterations is known.
                ** Iterates over sequences (list, tuple, string, range, etc.).
                    for item in iterable:
                        # loop block

                ** for loop using range - 
                    for i in range(1, 6):
                        print(i)

                ** while loops - 
                ** Used when number of iterations is unknown.
                    while condition:
                        # loop block
                ** no do-while loop in python.

        Jump Statements 
            break, continue, goto (in some languages), return.
            break - Exits the loop or switch immediately.
            continue - Skips the current iteration and continues the loop.
            return - Exits from the current method and optionally returns a value.
            goto  - python does not support goto.
