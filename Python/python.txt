🐍 Python (Simplicity & Rapid Development)

✅ Dynamically Typed 
    → No need to declare variable types (x = "Hello").
✅ Interpreted Language 
    → No compilation required (python script.py).
✅ Duck Typing 
    → Objects are defined by behavior rather than explicit types.
✅ Multi-Paradigm (OOP + Functional + Procedural) 
    → Supports classes, functions, and scripting.
✅ Extensive Standard Library (os, sys, math) 
    → Includes built-in utilities.
✅ Metaprogramming (type(), eval()) 
    → Modify classes and objects at runtime.
✅ Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) 
    → Prevents true multi-threading but simplifies memory management.
✅ Easy-to-Use Async (asyncio) 
    → Supports asynchronous programming, but not as optimized as JavaScript or Rust.
✅ Great for AI/ML & Data Science (NumPy, TensorFlow) 
    → Python dominates in scientific computing.
✅ Dynamic Code Execution (exec(), eval()) 
    → Can run code stored as strings at runtime.

💡 Best Used For → Data science, AI/ML, scripting, web development (Django, Flask).
