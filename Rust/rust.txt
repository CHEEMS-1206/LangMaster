ðŸ¦€ Rust (Memory Safety & Zero-Cost Abstractions)

âœ… Ownership Model 
    â†’ Prevents memory leaks by enforcing strict rules (move, borrow).
âœ… No Null Pointers 
    â†’ Uses Option<T> instead of null, eliminating NullPointerException.
âœ… No Garbage Collector 
    â†’ Memory is automatically freed when it goes out of scope.
âœ… Compile-Time Thread Safety 
    â†’ Borrow checker prevents race conditions.
âœ… Pattern Matching (match) 
    â†’ More powerful than switch-case (match x { Some(v) => v, None => 0 }).
âœ… Zero-Cost Abstractions 
    â†’ High-level constructs with no runtime overhead.
âœ… Memory-Safe Concurrency 
    â†’ Threads are safe at compile-time (std::thread::spawn).
âœ… Immutable by Default 
    â†’ Variables cannot be changed unless explicitly marked (mut).
âœ… Built-in Safety for Error Handling (Result<T, E>) 
    â†’ No need for exceptions.
âœ… No Implicit Type Conversions 
    â†’ Prevents bugs like JavaScriptâ€™s "5" + 5.

ðŸ’¡ Best Used For â†’ System programming, web assembly (WASM), blockchain, embedded systems.
