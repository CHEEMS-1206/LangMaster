ðŸš€ C++ (Performance & System-Level Control)

âœ… Manual Memory Management 
    â†’ new/delete, malloc/free for precise control over memory.
âœ… RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) 
    â†’ Ensures resources like memory, file handles, and sockets are properly freed.
âœ… Multiple Inheritance     
    â†’ A class can inherit from multiple parent classes, unlike Java and Rust.
âœ… Templates & Meta-Programming 
    â†’ Enables compile-time generic programming (template<typename T>).
âœ… Low-Level Access & Pointers 
    â†’ Full control over system memory (int* ptr = &x;).
âœ… Inline Assembly 
    â†’ Directly write assembly code inside C++ (asm("mov eax, ebx")).
âœ… Deterministic Destruction 
    â†’ Objects are destroyed exactly when they go out of scope, unlike Java/Pythonâ€™s garbage collection.
âœ… Zero Runtime Overhead 
    â†’ Unlike Java, Python, and JavaScript, C++ has no runtime dependency.
âœ… Exception Handling (But Unsafe) 
    â†’ Supports throw/catch, but does not enforce handling like Java.

ðŸ’¡ Best Used For â†’ Game development, high-performance computing, system programming, embedded systems.
